dnstap: flexible, structured event replication format for DNS servers
---------------------------------------------------------------------

dnstap implements an encoding format for DNS server events. It uses a
lightweight framing on top of event payloads encoded using Protocol Buffers and
is transport neutral.

dnstap can represent internal state inside a DNS server that is difficult to
obtain using techniques based on traditional packet capture or unstructured
textual format logging.

This repository contains a command-line tool named "dnstap" developed in the
Go programming language. It can be installed with the following command:

    go get -u github.com/dnstap/golang-dnstap/dnstap
